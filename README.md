This is a beginner level BlackJack game using object Oriented Programming. The way I split up the project is to have a file that is a singular card with a face (2-10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) and Suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades). The next file is where most of the action is at, and I may have gotten a bit lazy with organization but the methods that I have are a create deck, shuffle, deal, hit, hit/stand. The play game method will tie all of the pieces together into a system that (I hope) follows the rules of blackjack! The project as a whole took me about 3-4 hours and if you have any suggestions about how I could make the program better let me know, I am still learning CPP as well as Object Oriented Programming.
